# 🔭 I’m currently working on
A website with topics about travel, where there are a bunch of reporters (the reporters are super users with the ability to upload new topics and edit their own topics), and users who need to register to watch these topics.
I develop my website with MERN Fullstack (React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB).
